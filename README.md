#### Formatting and linting
reference as [Linting Python in Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/linting#_pylint)

#### Issues
- how to call Parent class methods within the overridden methods?

    There are two ways. one is Parentâ€™s class methods can be called by using the Parent classname.method inside the overridden method. another is using super().
    
    refer to [Python: Call Parent class method](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-call-parent-class-method/)

- The message `Activate.ps1 is not digitally signed. You cannot run this script on the current system.` is showed while activate virtual environment in Windows operating system.

    ```console
    Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope Process
    ```
